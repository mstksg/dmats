So, this might be a desired sort of thing:

~~~
x : Int
x = 10

xs : Vec n Int
xs = [1..]

ys : Vec m Int
ys = [1..]

main = do
  stuff
  stuff
~~~

it should be sort of like the matlab language?  and idris?  sort of like a
combination.  a mixture between idris and matlab.  matlab gives nice syntax
stuff and idris gives dependent types.  let's do it.
